# ft_print_program_name

This repository hosts a simple C program that demonstrates how to print the name of the executable, as invoked from the command line, to the standard output. It utilizes command-line arguments to access the program name and employs a loop to print each character individually.

## Overview

The program is designed to be an educational tool for understanding command-line arguments in C programming, specifically `argc` and `argv`. It iterates over the characters of the first argument (the program name) and prints each character to the standard output using the `write` system call.
